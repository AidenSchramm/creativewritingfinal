Most notably, the uncomfortable changes brought on by the onset of puberty are alluded to by the lyrical description of a variety of “monstrous” traits. Throughout the song, a stark transition occurs at every chorus section, drawing parallels with the sudden occurence of dramatic changes during adolescence. Additionally, the song follows the album’s themes of opposites, or more specifically, dualities. This is especially highlighted by the chorus, which stresses the contrast between one’s internal and external selves.</span></p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrdSC9MVb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tally Hall - &amp;</strong></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Once again, this song follows the album’s theme of dualities and opposites. Most significant is the use of “&amp;”, both in the title of the song and throughout each chorus. Especially prominent is the obvious contrast between each of the things delimited by “&amp;”. Beginning with the somewhat inconspicuous “High &amp; Low”, and gradually transitioning to contrasts with greater depth and meaning. This takes place at the line “John &amp; Yoko”, which is in reference to the tumultuous relationship between John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Additionally, this serves to broaden the scope of the opposites referenced, pivoting from abstract concepts to objects, actions, and events. Finally, the outro forces the listener to accept the inevitability of conflict in the face of contrast, culminating with the desire to “wash away” the sins committed as a result of said conflict.</span></p><p> </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHjaNDGgYEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tally Hall - Taken for a Ride</strong></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    This song is part of a different album, and features a blatantly simple, yet elaborate metaphor for depression. Marvin, the one experiencing this depression, desperately searches for meaning in life in his pursuit of happiness. During each verse of the song, an upbeat and joyful melody accompanies the lyrics for the sake of Marvin “convincing” himself that he can “just be happy”. The true cause of this deep depression can be discerned from the chorus and outro, which allude to a “loss” of someone Marvin presumably cared deeply for. Based on the references to “chemistry”, it can be inferred that this “loss” was in fact the ending of a relationship, which has introduced a hole into Marvin’s life which he has been unable to reckon with.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 24, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/aiden-schramm/" class="invert" rel="author">Aiden Schramm</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./journals.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Journals</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
