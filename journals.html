As it stands, a somewhat neutral tone is used throughout the narrative, with very little to which one could relate to emotionally. Overall, the improvements that could be made would take very little time and effort to complete, and will drastically improve the readability and overall flow of the story. All that remains to be done is to simply create an appropriate conclusion to wrap everything up.</span></li></ul></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit 2A</span><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After‌ ‌a‌ ‌fair‌ ‌bit‌ ‌of‌ ‌deliberation,‌ ‌I‌ ‌will‌ ‌most‌ ‌likely‌ ‌elect‌ ‌to‌ ‌create‌ ‌a‌ ‌long-form‌ ‌fiction‌ ‌piece.‌ ‌Once‌ ‌I‌ ‌begin‌ ‌writing,‌ ‌I‌ ‌find‌ ‌it‌ ‌extremely‌ ‌difficult‌ ‌to‌ ‌perform‌ ‌any‌ ‌sort‌ ‌of‌ ‌context-switch‌ ‌to‌ ‌anything‌ ‌different,‌ ‌meaning‌ ‌that‌ ‌I‌ ‌would‌ ‌probably‌ ‌struggle‌ ‌to‌ ‌complete‌ ‌more‌ ‌than‌ ‌one‌ ‌piece‌ ‌of‌ ‌fiction‌ ‌thanks‌ ‌to‌ ‌the‌ ‌overhead‌ ‌introduced‌ ‌by‌ ‌performing‌ ‌such‌ ‌a‌ ‌pivot.‌ ‌This‌ ‌journal‌ ‌is‌ ‌retrospective‌ ‌in‌ ‌nature‌ ‌as‌ ‌I‌ ‌have‌ ‌already‌ ‌completed‌ ‌my‌ ‌fiction‌ ‌piece,‌ ‌however‌ ‌this‌ ‌is‌ ‌an‌ ‌accurate‌ ‌reflection‌ ‌of‌ ‌the‌ ‌process‌ ‌of‌ ‌deliberation‌ ‌I‌ ‌experienced‌ ‌while‌ ‌struggling‌ ‌to‌ ‌decide‌ ‌which‌ ‌task‌ ‌I‌ ‌would‌ ‌choose‌ ‌to‌ ‌complete.‌ ‌</span></li></ul></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit 2B</span><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to experience other stories was useful for getting ideas and strategies to incorporate into my own writing.

Both in my everyday interactions and my writing, I feel as if I have a decent grasp on how others may perceive situations differently. At the same time, I often struggle to see things exclusively from my own perspective, instead incorporating several different sources of detail into what I experience. Obviously it is impossible to literally experience life as another person, yet merely entertaining the idea of experiencing the life of another is a conduit to fostering a connection through which one can write about the subjective experience of an individual.</span></li></ul></li></ul></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 21, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aidenschramm.com/creativewritingfinal/authors/aiden-schramm/" class="invert" rel="author">Aiden Schramm</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aidenschramm.com/creativewritingfinal/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aidenschramm.com/creativewritingfinal/the-impossible-burger.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The Impossible Burger</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://aidenschramm.com/creativewritingfinal/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
