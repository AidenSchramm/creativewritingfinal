The air carried the smells and sounds of a dense city, though as the journey progressed these were drowned out by a refreshing tropical breeze coupled with the sounds of the forest as the sun slowly dipped below the horizon. We had arrived in the capital of Nicaragua, Managua, and we were en-route to that which was to be our home away from home for the next two weeks. A great many thoughts were running through my head, of which none I could possibly manage to grasp and hold on to long enough to make heads or tails of it. Yet still one feeling dominated everything else. I was “in my element” so to speak. Somewhere I could simply do something, with the tantalizing promise of real impact upon the world. Certainly these were lofty ambitions for an 8th grader, but those were my goals and I was determined to do my absolute best to achieve them. As the roads progressed from smooth concrete, to bumpy asphalt, to heaps of gravel barely keeping the plants at bay, I continued pondering what my time in the country would be like. Finally, after turning onto a dirt driveway riddled with tire tracks of varying sizes, we approached the farm where we would be staying. The bus doors creaked open, and our group was greeted by the farmers and their very enthusiastic dogs. After unloading our supplies and preparing for sleep, the night culminated in another greeting, this time in the form of a markedly less friendly scorpion in the washroom. Everyone slept with one eye open that night. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come morning, we woke and got ready for the day ahead at the crack of dawn, mostly thanks to the roosters in the coop barely 10 meters from us. We discussed several things as we ate a delicious breakfast, and laid out a plan for our travels. The trusty school bus we had ridden on was to be our main method of transportation, ferrying us from the mountainous peaks of the north to the grassland plains of the south. Though we had brought with us a number of medical supplies, we still needed to obtain a number of items which we could not bring with us on the plane. As such, we followed the same route taken the day prior back to Managua to get to the pharmacy. Afterwards, we met with representatives of the church with whom we had partnered to conduct this mission trip, and discussed the logistics of our planned journey. Accompanying us was to be two members of the church who were able to act as translators, with myself filling in as needed. Finally, we set off to our first destination, which was not very far from the church itself. The pastor unlocked the sturdy iron frame protecting the door, opened the ornate door with a creek, and we shuffled inside. So began our journey throughout the country, the day after we left from Managua and traveled to Somoto, where we set up a clinic at La Carbonera, a nearby school. Next, we traveled through Valle Cacauli and La Gorza, though it was a few days before we were able to set up another clinic. To reach our next destination, Las Joyas, we embarked on a bumpy ride through the arid Nicaraguan countryside. Being so far from the nearest city there was a total lack of any vehicles whatsoever, everyone we came across while driving was riding a carriage drawn by either horse, donkey, or ox. The last clinic we hosted was at El Bonete, which was located in a village right on the banks of the Rio del Gallo named Somotillo. To reach the village, we had to drive through said river in the bus as there was no bridge across. These 4 locations where we established our temporary clinics were miles and miles away from the nearest hospital, without any means to make the treacherous journey save from by horseback. We traveled from border to border and coast to coast, administering medical aid to everyone we were able to treat at the villages. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">   I was unable to truly grasp the magnitude of our actions at the time. The experience, the work, the people, the place, everything felt like one giant confusing mess. In retrospect, a mission trip to a foreign country is certainly quite the undertaking, but I sincerely put forth as much effort as I possibly could to improve the lives of those I met. To this day I cherish the fact that I had the opportunity to utilize my skills to the fullest extent possible in aiding people and communities in need.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 21, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://AidenSchramm.github.io/creativewritingfinal/authors/aiden-schramm/" class="invert" rel="author">Aiden Schramm</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://AidenSchramm.github.io/creativewritingfinal/the-impossible-burger.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> The Impossible Burger </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://AidenSchramm.github.io/creativewritingfinal/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://AidenSchramm.github.io/creativewritingfinal/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
