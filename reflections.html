I had done so once before that same year in my Spanish Social Studies class, however that was simply a surface-level presentation which was unable to adequately convey the depth and importance I felt it had. Although I do not place enormous importance on the ability to express myself, having the opportunity to do so, especially in such a raw manner, with little variance between thought and written word. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong><a href="./song-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Song Analysis Reflection:</a></strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    To be frank, I don’t particularly enjoy attempting to pin down the specific themes and concepts present within a piece of media through analysis. I often find myself completely missing ideas that are obvious in retrospect, which ends up being both a blessing and a curse. Through this blissful ignorance, I skip right past the things that would be straightforward and easy to write about, and instead inadvertently force myself to delve deeper to derive some sort of meaning or significance. This dynamic has enabled me to produce very unique perspectives in the analysis that I conduct, however it also impedes me from actually beginning to write said analysis due to a lack of ideas and a concrete starting point.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong><a href="./the-impossible-burger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Choice Reflection:</a></strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    This has been discussed before, but I have never worked in fast food. The vast majority of my cursory fast food knowledge comes from watching “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives”, with the rest stemming from friends’ anecdotes and Wikipedia. Overall, I’m quite proud of what I was able to accomplish when sufficiently motivated and driven to accomplish something. Even though I have experienced significant struggles in managing to achieve said motivated state, upon doing so I can produce high quality work that reflects the value of the labor expended in its creation. Plus, it was kinda humorous to write such a cheesy, “cheap horror”-style story about a giant mound of hamburger come to life.</span></p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 24, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/aiden-schramm/" class="invert" rel="author">Aiden Schramm</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./song-analysis.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Song Analysis</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="./final-reflection-essay.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Final Reflection Essay </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
