The strong dominate, while those too weak to resist are subjugated to the whims of the powerful. Alex had seen this statement crop up in a variety of places over the years, but he certainly did not expect to be considering such a philosophical quandary while being inches away from something </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">literally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trying to eat him. Right on his heels was an enormous heaping mass of artificial, lab-made, and self-replicating hamburger meat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Just an hour prior, the fast food restaurant he worked at had just received their first shipment of fully lab-grown meat. His manager had made the decision to partner up with a local bioengineering lab to serve these artificial burgers, with the promise of cheap, easily refrigerated, and cruelty-free meat. Unfortunately for all parties involved, cross-contamination between the labs’ production lines and the genetic engineering division had introduced some unique properties into what should have been delicious, non face-eating patties. Trace amounts of HeLa cells and dust mite genetic material had made their way into the first batch. The introduction of these factors alone would not have been enough to birth the meaty monstrosity, however an intern mistakenly introduced several ounces of mayonnaise by attempting to add the dressing to his sub sandwich, accidentally spilling most of it into the vat containing the meat. As the oozing mixture lurched along the conveyor belt into the refrigeration unit, the perfect circumstances for temporary preservation emerged. Though it would become dormant for the time being, the biological monstrosity would remain ready to spring to life should it thaw out. Fortunately for it, barely more than half a day would pass before it’s meaty, mutated form was slapped upon a searing hot grill. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    The subsequent denaturation of the mayonnaise acted as the catalyst for the awakening of the creature, which promptly began moving and twitching before finally achieving “consciousness”. It then began its search for that which it had been biologically programmed to eat: human flesh. Alex and his co-worker Josh were the unlucky souls to be working in the kitchen that evening. Each wielding a pair of stainless steel spatulas, they parried the relentless attacks of the hunk of meat and eventually managed to seal it inside the grease trap. The lonesome patty was no match for the two, but alas, the rest of the meat had been slowly thawing out nearby, and had just reached the ideal temperature. Oozing and sloshing, it hauled its monstrous form out of the large metallic container in which it had arrived, plopping onto the floor with a wet slap. Startled by the sound from behind them, Alex and Josh whipped around towards the source of the noise, mouths agape with horror as they saw the slimy creature wiggling its way towards them. Without missing a beat, they grabbed pots, pans, plates, anything they could get their hands on, and lobbed them at the beast. Enraged by the onslaught of improvised projectile weaponry, the monster stopped abruptly and trembled violently for a moment, then spawned several smaller clumps of meat from its flesh. It was at this point that they realized that even with coordination and strategy, there was no feasible way the two of them could take on the mountain of meat. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     And so began the chase, bolting out of the kitchen faster than they had ever ran in their lives with the mutated monstrosities hot on their heels. Just prior to unleashing hamburger armageddon Josh and Alex had finished closing up for the night, as such there were thankfully no patrons left to witness this traumatizing event. Even more fortunate was the fact that Alex had just mopped the linoleum floor, leaving it slick with soapy water. The two rounded the corner with relative ease, while the miscreations went sliding towards the far end of the restaurant, the first coming to a sudden halt as it slammed into a booth and the rest mashing into it one after the other. With a rather dramatic squelching sound, the individual clumps of meat recombined to become an even greater behemoth than before. However, even with the additional mass, it had no way to gain any traction, only being able to bounce itself like a pinball between the tables and booths littering the establishment. As the creature flopped and flailed about, the disgruntled employees began to hatch a plan to deal with it once and for all. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Firstly, they returned to the kitchen to deal with the lump of meat that remained stuck in the grease trap. Josh scooped it up with a large pot and Alex quickly slammed the lid on top, confining it once more. Returning to the seating area, they removed the lid and launched the tiny clump covered in grease towards its muculent progenitor. At that very moment, though it lacked all but the most basic of ingrained instincts, that miniscule clump of meat sailing gracefully through the air could be said to have been the happiest patty to have ever “lived”. It rejoined the original mass with a juicy smack, becoming a single large target. Next, they grabbed every single bag of flour they could find in the pantry, two long aluminum poles scavenged from dusters, and spools of wire from the maintenance kit. The plan was to create a “dust explosion” using the flour as material and an electric arc as the ignition. Alex carefully wrapped exposed wire around the base of both poles, wrapped both his arms with plastic garbage bags and used strips of the plastic to insulate the length of both poles from each other, leaving only the very tip exposed. Finally, he propped them up diagonally against a table, taking care not to get too close to the struggling pile of meat. Josh brought the flour, handed two already-open bags to Alex, and together they heaved the fine white powder into the air. Retreating behind the front counter, Alex plugged the exposed ends of wire into a nearby electrical outlet while Josh covered his ears, bracing for the noise. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    With a roar, the flour ignited and just about disintegrated everything in the immediate vicinity, shattering the closest windows and coating the interior of the restaurant with a fine layer of extremely well-done hamburger. Alex and Josh slowly came to their feet, observing the destruction they had wrought upon the creature and their surroundings. None of the meat twitched or moved, the malicious meat monster had been vanquished. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    “Well,”  remarked Alex, breaking the silence. “I think I might become a vegetarian after this.”</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 21, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/aiden-schramm/" class="invert" rel="author">Aiden Schramm</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./everything-i-am.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Everything I Am</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="./journals.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Journals </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
