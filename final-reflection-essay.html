That’s just about the only way I can summarize both my high school experience, and by extension, these English classes I have taken. Time and time again, I am forced to reckon with the cruel burden of being adept at writing, while struggling to muster up the motivation to actually even so much as begin writing. Throughout the many discussions I have had with you throughout these two years, I feel as if I have managed to attain a greater understanding of my own strengths and weaknesses in regards to the art of writing. This is, if anything, my greatest takeaway from this class. Each assignment conformed to, and was designed with the intention to complement a larger, overarching learning experience that provided invaluable lessons. For me, at the very least, these lessons were more of a figurative “wake-up call” that I really needed to take the time to figure things out. Which is kind of obvious in hindsight when looking at the entire experience highschool is intended to provide. However, I ended up spending half of my time worrying about the literal impact of not accomplishing everything. Which only served to blind me while said lessons were more or less “staring me in the face”. With the pace and structure of your English courses however, I was afforded a much different structure to adapt to and utilize for learning. A reprieve of sorts where I could gather my thoughts and take a long hard look at the system as a whole for the sake of attaining true comprehension and learning in the process. This is all a whole bunch of thoroughly abstract explanations which just about accurately describe my experience of “learning how to learn” in high school. As my senior year comes to a decisive end, I can confidently say that I will continue to put into practice the skills and knowledge I have fostered throughout my K-12 school years. It may have been a ridiculously bumpy ride, and I certainly was a thorn in the side to many as a result of my tumultuous period of self-discovery, but I still value that which I have learnt and the experiences that have defined who I am.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 24, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/aiden-schramm/" class="invert" rel="author">Aiden Schramm</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./reflections.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Reflections</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-05-24T21:14" class="feed__date">May 24, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="./reflections.html" class="invert">Reflections</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
